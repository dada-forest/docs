# Test Plan  

Research, develop, and test a plan to meet Evidence Act requirements for a comprehensive Forest Service data inventory, including metadata, and accompanying searchable data catalog. This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data.  Finally, meet Geospatial Data Act requirements.
