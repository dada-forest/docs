# Test Plan  

Research, develop, and test a plan to meet Evidence Act requirements for a comprehensive Forest Service data inventory, including metadata, and accompanying searchable data catalog. This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data.  Finally, meet Geospatial Data Act requirements.  

## Evidence Act  

The [Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/evidence-and-evaluation/){:target="_blank"} of 2018 requires federal agencies to develop evidence to support policymaking. Agencies must annually submit a systematic plan for identifying and addressing policy questions to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress.  

###  What is Evidence
Evidence is viewed as the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. Evidence can be quantitative or qualitative and may come from a variety of sources including foundational fact finding, performance measurement, policy analysis, and program evaluation. Evidence has varying degrees of credibility, and the strongest evidence comes from a portfolio of high quality, credible sources rather than a single source.
