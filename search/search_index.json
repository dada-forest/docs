This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data. Finally, meet Geospatial Data Act requirements.

Also included are 19110 (feature catalog standard) and 19157 (data quality). DCAT-US ver 1.1, also known as \"Project Open Data metadata\" (used by data.gov). Inventory and catalog datasets (including metadata, glossaries, data dictionaries, etc.) related to the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. Inventorying / cataloging other datasets is a longterm interest of the Forest Service and can be incorporated into this project as time allows.
